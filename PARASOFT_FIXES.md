# Parasoft Static Analysis Fixes

This branch contains fixes for static analysis violations found by Parasoft C/C++test.

## Branch: Satec-fixed

This branch contains production-ready fixes for critical static analysis violations while preserving the original `master` branch with training examples.

## Fixed Violations

### 1. Null Pointer Dereference - fee0s.c

**Violation**: "fee0s_env may possibly be null"

**Location**: `src/profiles/fee0/src/fee0s.c`, function `fee0s_get_att_idx()`, line 110

**Severity**: High - Could cause application crash

**Root Cause**: 
- `PRF_ENV_GET()` macro expands to `prf_env_get()` which can return NULL
- Direct dereference without null check: `fee0s_env->start_hdl`
- Other functions in same file properly check for NULL

**Fix Applied**:
```c
// Added null pointer check before dereferencing
if (fee0s_env == NULL) {
    return PRF_APP_ERROR;
}
```

**Verification**:
- Consistent with existing code patterns in the same file
- Early return prevents undefined behavior
- Appropriate error code returned

## Training Examples (master branch)

The `master` branch retains examples for training purposes:

### PWM Driver - Unreachable Code
- **File**: `src/plf/beken/src/driver/pwm/pwm.c`
- **Issue**: Unreachable default case in switch statement
- **Purpose**: Demonstrate static analysis warning patterns

## Build and Test

After applying fixes, verify with:
1. Static analysis scan
2. Compilation without warnings
3. Unit testing if available
4. Integration testing

---

## Branch Strategy

- `master`: Contains original code + training examples
- `Satec-fixed`: Contains production-ready fixes
- Both branches maintained for different purposes
